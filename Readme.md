# you need to have a data separated by space else set your delimiter in gnuplot

Now in this I'm analysing the path followed by a polymer chain. which have 20 monomer and their position.

So we need to put a loop which print this position of 20 monomer into other file, After that our gnuplot script read it from that file.

just change the parameter in plot.py accordingly.
